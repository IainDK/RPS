## RPS

RPS is a solo project that was built during my third week at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/career-support/). It was later updated to track basic statistics, such as: games played, wins and losses.

## Technology Used

This project uses Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Capybara, HTML, CSS and BootStrap.

## Functionality & Features

Users can sign-up and sign-in.

Once signed-in, users will be redirected to the home screen, where they can start a new game.

When a user begins a new game, they will be prompted to choose their weapon.

They will then be redirected to a screen that displays the outcome of the game, along with the option to play again.

Lastly, users can view their stats by visiting their profile page.

Note: W/L ratio does not take draws into consideration.
